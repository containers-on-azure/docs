# Step 1 - FrontEnd team Kick-off

## Goal

FrontEnd team built a initial mock version of the their application. Knowing that they will depend on other teams they have created a Fa√ßade/View API to isolate their web application dependency from other resources.

## Projects

|Project|Description|Stack|Dependencies|Branch|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|[FrontEnd.Web](https://github.com/containers-on-azure/FrontEnd)|Web UI|ASP.NET Razor Pages|FrontEnd.Api|version-00|
|[FrontEnd.Api](https://github.com/containers-on-azure/FrontEnd)|Web API|ASP.NET Web Api||version-00|

[FrontEnd.Web] &rarr; [FrontEnd.Api]

To debug the application run both projects in Visual Studio. Open the browser on http://localhost:5100/ which will show you the start page containing information about Stocks Market. This information is being pulled from http://localhost:5200/api/v1/contents. The base URI of the API is defined in the configuration setting ```FrontEndApi```, found in file ```appsettings.Development.json``` in FrontEnd.Web project.
